2021.6 Update: The pytorch and the tensorflow versions of the dlADMM code are available.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2020.4 Update: The dlADMM code is optimized without the cupy library and runs 10 times faster than the previous version. Each iteration takes only several seconds.
